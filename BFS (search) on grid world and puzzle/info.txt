Grid Environment - This code is in jupyter notebook 
				 - It creates the environment for the grid search
				 - Uses BFS with 4 directions to find the shortest path from start to goal
				 - Uses A* with 4 directions and manhattan heuristic to find the shortest path from start to goal
				 - Uses A* with 8 directions and euclidean heuristic to find the shortest path from start to goal
				 
Pariry check	- This creates the environment for the n^2 - 1 puzzle
				- Then solves it using the BFS search and then prints the path
