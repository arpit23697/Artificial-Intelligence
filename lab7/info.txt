in.txt 				- The test case given in the lab
in2.txt				- The test case created artificially for testing 

A* on map			- code in python in jupyter notebook
					- This contains the way to find the shortest path from the start state to the end state
					- Here we use the A* heurisitic with the euclidean heuristic 
					- In this we take the state as the vertex number
					
A* on time map 		- code in python in jupyter notebook for lab question 2
					- This contains two parts
							- First part
							- this finds the path with the minimum time to move from the start state to the goal state given the congestion
							- State is again given by the vertex number
							- A* heuristic which takes the euclidean distance / speed as the heuristic
							
							
							- Second part
							- Finds the path with minimum time but keeping the budget in eye from the start state to the goal state
							- State is given be the (vertex_number * budget_left) 
							- Accuracy of the budget is upto 0.01
							- A* heuristic which takes the euclidean distance / speed as the heuristic is used
							- Note the function takes three argument 1. congestion
																	 2. total budget
																	 3. cost for taking the bus (cost is in money / hour)
							- states which are having the negative budget are discarded
