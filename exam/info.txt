Description
In this in order to solve the n^2 - 2 puzzle we are using the A* algorithm with the manhattan heuristic
Here the state space (dimension * dimension)! / 2 state and the number of actions is equal to 8

In my code 8 represents the first blank and 9 represents the second blank
both are indistinguishable

Frontier , q (queue) , explored state , d (complete information about the state ) are the data structures used
First when we put the start state in the queue frontier update the value of d
Now in each loop : we pop the state with the minimum estimated cost, check if it is the goal state and then explore all the possible actions on
that state and put the new state in the frontier and the queue
If it is already in the frontier then update the cost if necessary
